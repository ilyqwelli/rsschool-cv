## About Me
I am 23 years old and I work as an information security specialist. I think I don't want to work in this field all my life, so I decided to try something new at rs shcool. I hope this course will give me a lot of new knowledge.

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS
* Java Skript (basic)
* Figma

## Code example
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.
'world'  =>  'dlrow'
'word'   =>  'drow'

```
function solution(str){
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
  console.log(solution("world"));
  console.log(solution("word"));
}
```
